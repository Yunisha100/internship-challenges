## **Process the log**

### What you need to do

* If you haven't already, take a [git class in codeschool](https://www.simplilearn.com/learn-git-basics-skillup).
* Once complete, create a private repo called "yipl-log-processor" in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* Solve the problem detailed below
* Push your code to the repo (make sure that you have multiple commits with proper messages) 
* Invite internship-bitbucket@yipl.com.np to that particular private repo
* Submit your application

#### Problem

##### Event management application

Develop an event management application such as a hackathon, seminar, college fest, etc., The event management application allows organizers/users to perform CRUD operations on events. Note: The management application can store data in a JSON file instead of a database. 
You can use any language or framework you like, although a core language (Python, PHP, NodeJS, etc ) is recommended. Based on your comfort level, you may use jQuery, vanilla JavaScript, or a JavaScript framework for the frontend part.

##### Requirements

 - Set up CRUD operation for events but instead of using a database just store the data in a JSON file.
 - Fields required: title, description, total number of participants, start date, end date, and any other fields that seem necessary according to the type of event. 
 - Implement both client-side and server-side validation 
 - Filter events by title, start date, and end date. 
 - Bonus part: Add authentication, and ensure that CRUD operations can only be performed when the user is authenticated.

##### Deliverables
 - Source code repository
 - A README file with prover setup instructions.
 - Screenshots of the application showing all the working functionalities	

### Bonus points

* If you can write and include unit tests for your code. 
* If you write readme files with the instructions necessary to run the code
